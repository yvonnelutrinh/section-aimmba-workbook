## Overview
In this homework, you will implement a sentiment analysis function that processes movie reviews and determines whether they express positive or negative sentiment.

## Task
Implement a function that analyzes movie reviews and extracts sentiment scores.

**Estimated Time:** 10 minutes

## Requirements
1. Implement the `analyze_sentiment()` function that takes a movie review text as input and returns a dictionary with 'thought' and 'sentiment' keys

2. Read the comments in the code to understand what needs to be completed
4. Complete the missing code sections

## Testing
Run the script to verify your implementation:

```bash
python main.py
```
