# Chaining Homework

## Overview
This homework explores the concept of chaining in LLM applications by comparing two approaches to customer service automation:
1. A single-step approach (`customer_service_chainless.py`)
2. A chained approach (`customer_service_chain.py` in the solution folder)

## Tasks
1. Run both implementations with the provided example
2. Compare the outputs and execution process
3. Consider these questions:
   - What are the advantages of breaking down the task into smaller steps?
   - When might a single-step approach be preferable?
   - What are the tradeoffs in terms of:
     - API costs
     - Response time
     - Maintainability
     - Debugging
     - Output quality
