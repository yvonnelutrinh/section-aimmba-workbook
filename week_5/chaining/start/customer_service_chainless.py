Customer Service LLM Chainless Example

This module demonstrates how NOT to handle customer service responses by trying to do everything
in a single LLM call. This is meant to be compared with the chained approach to show why
breaking down complex tasks into smaller steps is better.

Requirements:
- Python 3.8+
- openai
